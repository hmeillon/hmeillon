Hi there 👋!

My name is Héctor Meillon, a Full-Stack Developer in the making based in Mexico 🇲🇽. I'm a logistics engineer by profession,
but tech is what I love the most, which is the reason why I decided to go and learn how to code!
I'm open to learn from whoever wants to teach me, I'm very open minded when learning new things!

- 👀 I’m interested in tech, designing new and interesting things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever can help to improve my coding skills.
